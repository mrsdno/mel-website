        <h2>Paintings</h2>
        <p>
          Mel had a first successful solo exhibition at World Art Dubai in March
          2022 where she showcased 10 paintings. Mel’s paintings are a burst of
          bright, vibrant colors, hoping to spread positivity and good vibes to
          their new homes. A lot of Mel’s paintings are inspired by nature,
          women empowerment and her role as an educator. Music also plays an
          important role in the creation of the art pieces, from the sketches
          and composition phases, all the way to adding the finishing touches.
          takes on.
